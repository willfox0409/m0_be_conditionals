# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

Conditionals are useful when you need your code to make decisions based on specific conditions, such as user input or data values. They allow your program to adapt and respond differently depending on the circumstances.

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

I would have changed the variable assignments more to experiment with as many outputs as possible. I skipped some of the experiments at the end of the questions, only because I'm running behind. 

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

Everytime I think I've completely hit a wall, I find a resource to put me back on track. To know that we are given these resources in combination with our own problem solving skills to get back on the horse is becoming more and more satisfying. I kept reminding myself today, that I have been ingesting this content for no more than one week, and to be gracious with myself when I feel lost. I also got over a couple obstacles today with the help of a classmate and my instructors, which was inspiring, because I've felt pretty alone on a lot of this stuff so far.
